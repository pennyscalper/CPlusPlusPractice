1)Count Inversion
2)Closest pair in 2D
3)not a pan gram
4)Sort a list of words and integers, but integers should all(sort the input line that contains words and integers )   
remain in their original indices, and words should remain in their original indices.(The goal is to sort this 
list in such a way that all words are in alphabetical order and all integers are in numerical order. 
Furthermore, if the nth element in the list is an integer it must remain an integer, and if it is 
a word it must remain a word.)

5)Copy data-sets from among N servers to each other, so that   each server has a copy of all the data-sets 
this is like parallel computing communication.

time for ( all-to-all bcast ) = Log (n) * M

n = # machines
M = message size

Write a program to synchronize data sets between data centers using as few copies as possible.
Example 1:
----------
Input:

4
1 3 4
1 2 3
1 3
1 4 2

One Possible Correct Output:

2 2 1
4 1 2
2 2 3
4 4 3
3 1 4

6)print all subset of a set
7)There are a collection of particles. You are given a string   of 'L' and 'R's, where 'L' 
denote a left moving particle and 'R' denote a right moving particle. 
The moving speed is given as another parameter. Multiple particles could stay on the same position. 
Give the animation of the moving particles.
